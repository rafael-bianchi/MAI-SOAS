abstract="Carpooling is a way to share a car so that more than one person rides thesame vehicle at the same time. This might bring a lot of benefits as reducingthe costs (fuel consumption, tolls, parking, etc.), the stress of driving andthe most impacting in a town, the number of cars running at the same time. Carpooling is encouraged in cities that have problems with high trafficnot only because it reduces it, but because it is also eco-friendly. In touristic cities, in which the taxis have a lot of influence on the transport system and the city traffic, taxi carpooling could help the city increasethe number of passengers traveling at the same time, less waiting time andbenefit from a less polluted and stressful environment. This project aims tocreate a simulation of a taxi carpool system in a grid world using the MESAABM framework.",
